The *WebReserv EVENT Sidebar Booking Calendar* lets you add an **Event Calendar** to your sidebar that handles bookings and reservations.

Visitors to your website can view the Event Calendar and book events and/or sessions with your business directly through the sidebar.

The WebReserv system can handle any type of events, whether they are appointments, gym classes, yoga sessions, concerts, tours or anything else that works well as a scheduled EVENT.

If you are looking for the booking calendar for Hotels, B&B's, car rentals etc, i.e. something that doesn't run as an EVENT, then try the **WebReserv Embedded Booking Calendar** or the **WebReserv Sidebar Booking Calendar**.
